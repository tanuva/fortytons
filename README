================================

A devel snapshot of Panda3D >= 2011-08-22 is required.
Older builds lack parts of the Bullet integration code
and have different DebugNode API.

As of 2011-12-05, the FlyingCameraController requires
SciPy. Version 0.10.0 is known to work, others might or
might not do the job. Have a look at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/
SciPy also needs NumPy:
