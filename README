================================

Although the commit stats might look a little sad this project needed and received a lot of brainwork for a new drivetrain. Parts of it work already, but I try to commit code that is actually playable. Besides, its not my only project anymore (no envy!).

dependencies:
Panda3D >= 1.8.0 built with bullet physics support.
