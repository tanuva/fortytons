40tons.

================================

A devel snapshot of Panda3D >= 2011-08-22 is required.
Older builds lack parts of the Bullet integration code
and have different DebugNode API.

Todo:
- "only accelerate while arrow_up is pressed", same for braking
- basic speed sensitive steering
- reintegrate the dumping device
- speedometer (done!)

Ideas:
- make it dump! (at least pretend doing so)
- follower camera
- Implement more stuff as keyboard shortcuts
